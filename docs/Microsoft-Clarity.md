# Microsoft Clarity

Microsoft Clarity lets you record user sessions, generate heatmaps, scrollmaps and further analyze your website users. The service is completely free because the data is used by Microsoft to traing their AI models.

## Locating the Tag ID

Log into your [MS Clarity Dashboard](https://clarity.microsoft.com/projects) and if you have just created a new website, you will be met by installation instructions. Just select "Install manually" and in the code snippet select and copy the id of your project.
